Youtube really have a lot of useful clips.  
Sometimes when I have an idea, then I try to give some keyword to the youtube or google.   
Occasionally, something amazing will return to your screen.   

The below short film should be a one.   
It explained **active vocabulary and passive vocabulary**, its quite meet from my past experience.   
[how to learn English vocabulary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jK0IHubzHZo)   

From left to right, it gradually become harder.   
> reading   
> listening -> writing
>              speaking

More to say, the vocabulary learning, it quite resemeble with the programming learning process.   
If you already understood a piece of program, then the best way is discard the old pieces,    
recall and rewrite the program from scratch on blank papers.
