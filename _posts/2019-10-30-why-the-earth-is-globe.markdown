In my childhood and juvenile, I always have strong self-consciousness. 
That means I always found myself is distinctive, and different from other people.

As time goes by, something gradually become clear. That is you are a person, what you have each person 
will have.

It is hard for me to use a foreign language to express such subtle thoughts. 

For example, when you solved a problem, which is a difficult one, then you wants people know you are the one
who is the merely few people that can do it. In fact, serval people have done the problem.

Another example, when you look at some price that's really high, the other people will also notices that.
The consequence maybe change, because not only you two guys noticed this.

The earth is global, it give us a wrong perspective, that ourself is the center, others is the belongings.
But from every other's perspective, he will thought he was at the center. So the conflict will be indispensable.
